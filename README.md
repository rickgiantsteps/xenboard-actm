# Interactive Microtonal Keyboard
XenBoard is an interactive keyboard and synth that allows the user to play with, create and explore microtonal tunings.

The application gives the opportunity to create equally tempered scales and to customize multiple parameters, in order to
have as much control as possible on the resulting scale.
It also provides the possibility to play with and explore a variety of historical and non equally tempered tunings
from a vast and detailed database.

Libraries used: 
+ **Tone.js** (https://tonejs.github.io/),
+ **Tune.js** (https://github.com/abbernie/tune)
+ **p5.js** (https://github.com/processing/p5.js)

The use of tunings that divide the octave into intervals other than those prescribed by European classical tonality
is known as microtonality.

Microtonality provides artists with a greater range of notes to choose from and expands
their options for harmonic and melodic expression.
It offers a wider spectrum of dissonances and makes it possible to create novel or uncommon chord progressions and keys.

Our objective with this project was to create an easy-to-use and intuitive tool that could bring musicians closer
to understanding this often overlooked field of music.

### General Introduction

On startup, the user is greeted with the classic 12EDO (12 Equal Divisions of the Octave, the usual 12 tone
equal temperament used in the vast majority of western music) system.

  The theme of the operating system (dark/light) is automatically detected and the colors
  of the instrument are displayed accordingly, this is automated by performing a media query on the window in which the program is running. 
  The theme can be changed at any time by clicking the moon/sun icon present in the top right corner.

The keyboard is displayed under the customizable parameters. It consists of an hexagonal grid
of keys each corresponding to a different note in the created scale. Each octave is colored differently
with an alternating three-colour pattern, this was implemented in order to make it clearer when the scale repeats.

Above the keyboard there are a few parameters available that the user can interact with, some are only visible depending on the
current mode that has been selected (explained below in the *Keyboard Modes* section of the README) while some are always present and can be interacted with.

These are:
+ **Central Frequency**: corresponds to the frequency of the first note of the central octave created in the scale
+ **Lower/Higher Octaves buttons**: they allow the user to add or remove octaves with respect to the central one
+ **Polyphony**: indicates the maximum numbers of notes that are allowed to play simultaneously (if the number of keys
  pressed is over this number, the first note that was pressed is stopped in order to allow the newer one to play)

The "**Main Tunings**" dropdown menus is always present, but its contents vary (explained in the *Keyboard Modes* section).

A polygon is present above these parameters, showing an alternative visual representation of the scale. The polygon's number of sides is automatically
updated to be equal to the number of notes of the current scale. On each vertex the ratio between the first note of the octave and the others frequencies
of the scale is displayed (clockwise, starting from the top vertex corresponding to the unison). It's implemented using the p5.js library.

  <br/>
  Everytime a key is pressed a line connects the center to the the vertex on the polygon that corresponds to that particular note. The lines are colored
  depending on which octave is being played (the color corresponds to the one the key has on the keyboard). This allows the user to better understand which 
  notes are being played, even if the melody or harmony spans multiple octaves.

There's also the possibility to record what is played on the keyboard, listen to the recording once it's stopped and the chance to
eventually download it. The *toggle recording* button is present on the top left of the instrument and, once pressed, it sticks itself to the corner
of the screen following the scrolling of the page, so that the recording can be stopped at any time without having to scroll back to the top of the page.

## Keyboard Modes

The instrument has two main modes: **Creation** and **Exploration**. The main features of the keyboard remain the same but switching between them allows
the user to have more or less control on the temperaments they can create and which scales they have access to.

To switch from one mode to the other all that is required is to press the **Toggle Tuning Mode** button.

### Creation Mode

In this mode the user can customize their own equally tempered tuning, meaning that every note is equally spaced in the selected interval (depends on the value
of the "**root**" parameter). 

The parameters that can only be interacted with exclusively in this mode are:
+ **Note Number**: the number of notes in which the selected interval (determined by the value of the "**Root**" parameter) will be divided into
+ **Root**: the interval used in the calculation of the scale, it indicates the range of frequencies that will be used in the creation of the scale. By default this value is equal to two, in this case the range is equal to the "octave" (interval 1:2), there's also the option to use the "tritave" (1:3) and the intervals 1:4 and 1:5

These two values are used in the computation of the scale: each consecutive note, starting from the central frequency, will be multiplied by the nth root of the value selected in the parameter **Root**, creating the desired equally tempered scale.

In this mode the **Main Tunings** dropdown contains the most known and commonly used EDO (Equal Division of the Octave) systems, in order to give quick access to some useful tunings with no experimentation needed.

### Exploration Mode

In this second mode there's less control regarding the customization of the temperament in favor of a wider choice of predefined historical tunings and other systems used in other musical cultures around the globe. <br/> The user will not be able to adjust the number of notes or the ratio used to create the scale, they will have the possibility though to search for and choose from the numerous scales present in the database provided by **tune.js**.

![exploration mode screenshot](/images/exploration-mode.png)

In the **Main Tunings** dropdown in this mode there are some of the more popular and known non equally tempered scales, these are both historical european tunings that are seldom used nowadays and tunings that are used to this days in other parts of the world.

To not limit the user to these few predefined tunings, **tune.js**' database of over 3000 tunings was integrated into the project. This DB is accessible by using the appropriate input search field present in this mode. The tunings that are available to be selected can be viewed by clicking on the green highlighted text next to the search field (https://abbernie.github.io/tune/scales.html). <br/> In this webpage provided by tune.js all the descriptions of the tuning systems can be read and the corresponding value copied and then pasted into the instrument, which then allows to click on and load the chosen temperament. <br/> There's also the possibility to search for the desired tuning within XenBoard itself, since the app automatically filters the database to provide options matching the input of the search, allowing to choose from a range of tunings (as is shown in the previous screenshot). 

## Dissonance Visualization

Since microtonality is often a foreign concept to many musicians and users, further visualisations of the qualities of the temperaments that can be selected or created using XenBoard
are implemented. <br/> A graph, implemented with **p5.js**, displays the pleasantness (calculated using Euler's Gradus, explained in the next section) of each interval present in the scale along with value of its average and total Gradus. <br/> In addition the same method is used to calculate the melodic dissonance of what the user is playing, along with the harmonic dissonance (this last one uses a different algorithm, explained in its section of the README). Both of these two values are updated in real time as they follow the performance.

### Scale and Melodic Dissonance (Gradus Suavitatis)

On the right-hand side of the instrument the dissonance of the scale is displayed, along with the melodic dissonance.
Both of these values are calculated using **Euler's Gradus Function**.

According to Euler the degree of melodiousness is related to the complexity of mental calculation required by the listener, which is inversely proportional to how pleasant their experience is.

Eulerâ€™s formula takes into consideration the ratios of natural numbers, reflecting the frequency ratio of the two notes, it uses this ratio to assign a consonance value to the interval in question: f(n1:n2) = d. Where "f" is the Gradus function, "n1" and "n2" are the interval's ratio integers and "d" the **Gradus Suavitatis** (consonance degree). <br/><br/>
Let n be a positive integer which consists of the nominator times the denominator of the interval.
Suppose its prime factorization is:

![euler's gradus function](/images/euler-gradus.png)

The degree of melodiousness is high if the decomposition contains number primes with low values, resulting in a low gradus suavitatis (for example, the unison 1:1 has the lowest possible gradus of 1, resulting in high melodiousness).
On the other hand, it is low if it has primes that appear multiple times and/or it has a lot of prime numbers in the decomposition. 
Therefore the smaller the value the more pleasing the interval.

A graph is built in order to visualize the **scale dissonance** in the selected temperament.<br/>
The x-axis of the graph represents the number of notes present, while the y-axis represents the gradus suavitatis for that particular interval.

The **melodic dissonance** value, that is updated in real time, uses the same function used in the graph, assigning a gradus suavitatis value to two notes played consecutively by the user as they perform on the instrument.

### Harmonic Dissonance (Sethares' algorithm)

In this particular section, a value was also implemented, which updates in real time, that indicates the current harmonic
dissonance of the notes that are being played.

**Sethares' algorithm** computes a curve of perceptual dissonance from a sound signal. 

The code takes into consideration common perceptual dissonance curves, with the difference that the minima points of the curve that indicate ratios of frequencies are known.

![equations used in sethares' algorithm](/images/sethares.jpg)

In order to take into account the different harmonic components of more complex sounds (non-sinusoidal waves), Sethares explains that the total dissonance for complex sounds is composed by the sum of the dissonances between all simultaneously sounding partials. We've taken this into consideration when calculating the value, giving different results depending on the waveform selected for the oscillator in the Synth section of XenBoard.

Furthermore, the contribution of the partials in the dissonance calculation is determined by their amplitudes.

## Synth and Effects

A synth and effects section was added so that users could have the option to customize the sound of the microtonal keyboard. <br/>
The javascript library **Tone.js**, a useful Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser, was used to implement the wave generation and processing in both sections.

![synth and effects screenshot](/images/synth-effects.png)

The synth section gives users the possibility of using one or two oscillators.
Each oscillator can be customized by modifying these paramaters:
+ **Waveform**: shape of the wave played by the synth
  - *Triangular*
  - *Sine*
  - *Square*
  - *Sawtooth*
+ **Oscillator type**: the synth implements an "OmniOscillator", the user can choose between the different types of oscillators implemented by Tone.js. These are:
  - **Normal** (*Tone.synth*): basic synthesizer with a single oscillator
    - *Number of used partials*
    - *ADSR envelope*
  - **AM** (*Tone.AMOscillator*): controls the amplitude of the carrier signal
    - *Number of used partials*
    - *Harmonicity*: ratio between the carrier and the modulating oscillator
    - *ADSR envelope*
  - **FM** (*Tone.FMOscillator*): controls the frequency of the carrier signal
    - *Number of used partials*
    - *Harmonicity*: ratio between the carrier and the modulating oscillator
    - *Modulation*: amount of frequency modulation
    - *ADSR envelope*
  - **Fat** (*Tone.FatOscillator*): provides multiple oscillators and detunes them slightly from each other to thicken the sound
    - *Number of used partials*
    - *Count*: sets the number of oscillators
    - *Harmonicity*: ratio between the carrier and the modulating oscillators
    - *ADSR envelope*

Thanks to Tone.js the output of the synth can be routed through one (or more) effects before being played.

Different features can be selected for each effect:
+ **Volume**: controls the amplitude of the output signal
+ **Vibrato**: frequency of the signal modulated by an LFO
  - *Frequency*: frequency of the LFO
  - *Depth*: amplitude of the LFO
+ **Tremolo**: amplitude of the signal modulated by an LFO
  - *Frequency*: frequency of the LFO
  - *Depth*: amplitude of the LFO
+ **Distortion**: controls the amount of distortion applied to the signal
+ **Chorus**: left and right channel delay controlled by an LFO
  - *Frequency*: frequency of the LFO
  - *Delay*: amount of delay applied to both channels
  - *Depth*: amplitude of the LFO
+ **Reverb**: controls the reverb's size applied to the signal

In addition to the effects, the synth is also passed through a compressor in order to reduce the volume of loud sounds and amplifies particularly quiet sounds.
